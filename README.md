# Bus_Management_System

Develop a bus management system in Badulla.

Reason for choosing the problem:

●	When accessing the bus system in Badulla daily, we had to face some troubles due to the pure management of the bus system. Even though there are issued timetables for long-distance buses, the bus drivers do not follow the timetable or sometimes certain buses are not in service on a particular day. To solve this issue, we thought of introducing a Bus management system in Badulla.


Expectations from this program:
●	Save the time of passengers.
●	To find the presence and absence of drivers and conductors.
●	Seat booking availability.
●	Schedule buses according to the requests of passengers.
●	Add new bus routes according to the request of passengers.
●	To mention leaves or overtime slots for drivers and conductors easily.
●	Get notification for passengers, drivers, conductors and management according to their needs.
